# EasyHubV2

## Why V2?
This project is a refreshed version of the original EasyHub. It includes:
- Improved structure and documentation.
- Simplified architecture for maintainability.
- A fresh implementation with lessons learned from the first iteration.

The original project is preserved at [EasyHub](https://github.com/your-username/EasyHub).
