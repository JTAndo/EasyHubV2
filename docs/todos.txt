We followed more of an OOP with classes of the users and seperated the db stuff with the users. 
Also wrote a docker compose for the postgres and a sql script to build the dbs. 
 Looks like the tables are being produced but getting a : 


 [2025-01-19T19:26:09.940Z] Database configuration: {'host': 'localhost', 'database': 'easyhubv2', 'user': 'admin', 'port': '5432'}
[2025-01-19T19:26:09.950Z] Unexpected error: BOOOOOO Error connecting to database: connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  database "easyhubv2" does not exist

Not sure why. I believe its a docker issue.
